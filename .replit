# Replit configuration file for the Pexels Image Explorer project.
# This file tells the Replit IDE how to run the Flask web application.

# The command to execute when the "Run" button is pressed.
# - FLASK_APP=app.py: Sets the environment variable to tell Flask which file contains our application instance.
# - flask run: The standard command to start the Flask development server.
# - --host=0.0.0.0: Makes the server publicly accessible, which is necessary for it to work in the Replit environment.
# - --port=8080: Explicitly sets the port, which is good practice in containerized environments like Replit.

# Specifies the main file to open in the editor when the project loads.
# 'app.py' is the backend entrypoint, making it a logical choice.
entrypoint = "app.py"

# Specifies the programming language and version.
# This helps Replit provide the correct environment, linter, and debugger.

# Enables or disables guessing which packages to install.
# It's good practice to manage dependencies explicitly via `pyproject.toml` (with Poetry)
# or `requirements.txt` (with pip), so we can leave this as is.
